# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2020-10-30
### Change
* Added TLS Support for both GRPC and HTTP interfaces #76
* Prometheus metrics are now prefixed with `gubernator_`
* Switched prometheus Histograms to Summary's

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2020-10-22
### Change
* Added `GUBER_DATA_CENTER` as a config option
* Use `GUBER_PEER_DISCOVERY_TYPE` to pick a peer discovery type, removed
'Enable' options from k8s, etcd, and member-list.
* Added `GUBER_ADVERTISE_ADDRESS` to specify which address is published for
discovery
* Gubernator now attempts to detect the proper `GUBER_ADVERTISE_ADDRESS` if
not specified
* Gubernator now binds to `localhost` by default instead of binding to
`0.0.0.0:80` to avoid allowing
  access to a test version of gubernator from the network.
* Fix inconsistent tests failing #57
* Fix GRPC/HTTP Gateway #50
* Renamed functions to ensure clarity of version
* Removed deprecated `EtcdAdvertiseAddress` config option
* Refactored configuration options
* `member-list` metadata no longer assumes the member-list address is the same
  as the gubernator advertise address.
* Now MD5 sums the peer address key when using replicated hash. This ensures
  better key distribution when using domain names or ip address that are very
  similar. (gubernator-1, gubernator-2, etc...)
* Now defaults to `replicated-hash` if `GUBER_PEER_PICKER` is unset
* Added support for DataCenter fields when using etcd discovery
* Now storing member-list metadata as JSON instead of glob

## [0.9.2] - 2020-10-23
### Change
* ETCD discovery now sets the IsOwner property when updating the peers list.

## [0.9.1] - 2020-10-19
### Change
* Fix GUBER_PEER_PICKER_HASH and GUBER_PEER_PICKER
* Now warns if GUBER_PEER_PICKER value is incorrect
* Now ignoring spaces between `key = value` in config file

## [0.9.0] - 2020-10-13
### Change
* Fix GUBER_MEMBERLIST_ADVERTISE_PORT value type
* Fixed race condition and updated tests for limit change
* Fix limit change not having effect until reset

## [0.8.0] - 2020-01-04
### Added
* Allow cache users to invalidate a ratelimit after a specific time
* Changing limit and duration before expire should now work correctly
* Added Behavior RESET_REMAINING to reset any hits recorded in the cache for the
  specified rate limit

## Changes
* TokenBucketItem is now provided when `OnChange()` is called instead of `RateLimitResp`
* Fixed a bug in global behaviour where it would return an error if the async
  update had not occured before the a second request is made. Now it acts like it
  owns the rate limit until the owning node sends an update
* Always include reset_time in leaky bucket responses
* Fixed subtle bug during shutdown where PeerClient passed into goroutine could
  be out of scope/changed when routine runs
* Behavior is now a flag, this should be a backward compatible change for
  anyone using GLOBAL or NO_BATCHING but will break anyone using
  DURATION_IS_GREGORIAN. Use `HasBehavior()` function to check for behavior
  flags.

## [0.7.1] - 2019-12-10
### Added
* Added `Loader` interface for only loading and saving at startup and shutdown
* Added `Store` interface for continuous synchronization between the persistent store and the cache.
### Changes
* Moved `cache.Cache` into the `gubernator` package
* Changed the `Cache` interface to use `CacheItem` for storing and retrieving cached items.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-11-12
### Added
* DURATION_IS_GREGORIAN behavior to support interval based ratelimit durations
* Fixed issue where switching to leakybucket was impossible
* Fixed rate would never decrease if the client continued to add hits and failed.

## [0.5.0] - 2019-07-23
### Added
* Support for prometheus monitoring
* Support for environment based config
* Support for kubernetes peer discovery

## [0.4.0] - 2019-07-16
### Added
* Support for GLOBAL behavior
* Improved README documentation
### Changes
* GetRateLimits() now fetches rate limits asynchronously

## [0.3.2] - 2019-06-03
